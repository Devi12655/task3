As part of my Web Development Internship at ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd, I worked on building dynamic, user-friendly tools using JavaScript and external APIs.

âœ… Highlights of the Task:
ðŸ”¹ Wikipedia Search Tool â€“ Created a real-time search interface using the Wikipedia API
ðŸ”¹ JavaScript & DOM â€“ Dynamically created and updated UI elements (titles, links, descriptions) based on live search results
ðŸ”¹ External API Handling â€“ Integrated API requests using fetch() and handled JSON data
ðŸ”¹ Interactive Quiz â€“ Built a fully functional quiz app that tests knowledge of JavaScript, DOM, and responsive design concepts
ðŸ”¹ Responsive Design â€“ Ensured smooth experience across devices using media queries and adaptive layout techniques

ðŸ“Œ This task enhanced my practical skills in API integration, DOM manipulation, and building interactive web apps â€” key steps in becoming a frontend developer.

ðŸŽ¯ It helped me understand how real-world applications fetch, display, and react to user data in real-time!
